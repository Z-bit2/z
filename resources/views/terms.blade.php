      </div>

       <p> At Frexa, we believe in plain English.  Our terms and conditions are legal, but written so that they are clear and easy to understand.  Here they are:</p>
        <ol class="termlist">
            <li>These terms and conditions are a contract.  By using any part of the Frexa website or product, you agree to all of the terms and conditions.  If you do not agree with any of the terms and conditions, do not use Frexa.</li>
            <li>Frexa is an experimental product.  If it breaks, we are not responsible.  If it gets hacked or goes down, we are not responsible.  Use it at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Ravencoin is an experimental blockchain.  If it breaks, we are not responsible.  If it gets hacked or goes down, we are not responsible.  Use it at your own risk.</li>
            <li>We can take Frexa down at any time without notice.  Your asset will still exist on the blockchain, but you will need to reissue it with new documents and metadata.  We want to keep Frexa going, but we are not responsible for any losses if we shut the site down.</li>
            <li>Frexa is in the making blockchain assets easy business, not the data mining business. We have standard access and error reporting logs on our server. We use this data exclusively to find and debug errors on the server and for no other purpose. We also store the email address you provide when setting up a wallet, and encrypt the other data you type in.  We use this information to provide you with Frexa’s features.  We will never sell your information. Period.</li>
            <li>Frexa Wallet is a non-custodial wallet. This means that your seed words, and the private keys derived from them, are never revealed to Frexa or stored on Frexa’s servers. We also do not have access to your password or pin. This makes it very important that you write down your unencrypted seed words when you create your wallet. If you forget your password and pin, we cannot reset them for you. In that case, if you do not have your seed words, your wallet will be lost forever.</li>
            <li>Frexa charges a small fee for use of the Asset Builder tools, which include icon uploading and document creation features, proper formatting of transaction information to facilitate later viewing with Asset Viewer, and temporary IPFS pinning of documents and metadata.  The fee is equal to 5% of the RVN network burn fee and is used to support further development of the Frexa platform. We do not currently charge a fee for when you send RVN from your wallet or broadcast transactions to the Ravencoin network.</li>
            <li>We are not your lawyer and Frexa does not give legal advice.  You should talk to a lawyer before using Frexa.  Frexa is not responsible if you do not.</li>
            <li>You promise not to use Frexa for anything illegal.  If you do, and we learn of it, we will kick you off the site, and you will be responsible for any losses to Frexa. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 230(d), we notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available - including on the Google Chrome Web Store - that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.</li>
            <li>You release us from all claims relating to your use of Frexa.  That means we have no liability to you of any kind for anything, and you cannot sue Frexa for anything.  If you bring a claim against us even though you have released us, you will pay us the attorney fees we incur in getting your claim dismissed.</li>
            <li>We have to put this one in with all the legal lingo: Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration before a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in the City, County and State of New York, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL and submit to personal jurisdiction of the City, County and State of New York in connection with any such dispute.  The governing law in connection with such dispute, and the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract, shall be the law of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We hope you enjoy using Frexa.  Please let us know if you have any suggestions so we can make Frexa better!</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>The Frexa team<br>
